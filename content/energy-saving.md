Although most floor registers and ceiling-mounted vents can be closed, they should be kept open even in rooms that are used infrequently. Closed vents make your air conditioner run longer and use more energy because less air is being fed back into the system."

Some structures used primitive materials that have settled or deteriorated over the years. If your home is drafty, adding insulation to the attic and crawlspace will have the biggest impact. After that, weatherize windows, doors and other drafty areas. Use caulk to seal cracks. Apply foam or felt weather stripping on door jambs and around window frames."

In the winter, the blades should spin clockwise. Use the lowest speed setting to push the warm air away from the ceiling without creating an uncomfortable breeze."
